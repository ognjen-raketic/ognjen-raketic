# 👋 Hi, I'm Ognjen Raketic, M.Eng.

# 🚀 About Me
# ---

```r
# My journey: From industrial engineering and management to Data Science and Quantitative Analysis.
# I'm passionate about extracting insights and solving complex problems using data.

# Where I once optimized factory floors, I now optimize data flows and analytical models.
# Where I once resolved physical bottlenecks, I now find and resolve data frictions and algorithmic challenges.
# Driven by industrial engineering precision, financial quantitative rigor, and the joy of continuous improvement,
# I'm building the bridge between operational excellence and data-driven digital transformation.

# 💡 I'm open to full-time roles, relocation support, or hybrid positions in Austria.
# Let's connect and explore how I can contribute to your Data Science or Quantitative team.
