# 👋 Hi, I'm Ognjen Raketic, MEng

## 🚀 About Me  
From leading technical teams in manufacturing to designing resilient infrastructure in the cloud — my journey from Industrial Engineering to DevOps is a reflection of my passion for building reliable, scalable, and secure systems.

Where I once optimized factory floors, I now optimize pipelines.  
Where I once solved physical bottlenecks, I now resolve deployment frictions.  

Driven by automation, structure, and the joy of continuous improvement, I'm building the bridge between engineering precision and digital transformation.

💡 I'm open to full-time roles, relocation support, or hybrid positions based in Austria. Let’s connect and explore how I can bring value to your DevOps team from day one.

## 🌱 Learning Goals

Currently immersed in real-world DevOps workflows, focusing on:

- AWS Cloud architecture and cost-efficient scaling (FinOps principles)
- DevSecOps practices: embedding security into Terraform, CI/CD and IAM
- Observability: setting up alerting and metrics with Prometheus & Grafana
- Kubernetes networking, RBAC, and Helm for production-grade clusters
- Communication and leadership within cross-functional agile teams

  This learning journey is not just about becoming a better DevOps engineer — it's about becoming a reliable teammate, a problem solver, and someone who helps systems (and people) run better.
