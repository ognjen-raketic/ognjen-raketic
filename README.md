👋 Hi, I'm Ognjen Raketic, MEng

🚀 About Me

I once mapped out factory floors and orchestrated machines; now, I design cloud systems that hum with digital precision. My journey from industrial engineering into DevOps isn’t just a career shift — it’s a transformation of how I see the world: as a canvas of processes waiting to be optimized, secured, and scaled. I believe in pipelines that ship bold ideas into reality, automation that liberates human creativity, and code that lives beyond the terminal window. If you share this vision, let’s connect and build the future, one container at a time.

🔥 Skills

  *Cloud: AWS (EC2, IAM, VPC, Lambda, S3, RDS, ECS, CDK)

  *Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Ansible

  *Containers: Docker, Kubernetes

  *CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions

  *Scripting: Bash, Python

  *OS: Rocky Linux

🛠️ Current Projects

  *Building AWS infrastructure with Terraform

  *Creating CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins & GitHub Actions

  *Automating Docker-based microservices deployments

  *Learning Kubernetes orchestration and Helm

🌱 Learning Goals
I’m immersing myself in the ecosystem of modern DevOps: mastering AWS services (EC2, S3, Lambda, VPC), weaving security into every line of Terraform code, building CI/CD pipelines that deliver reliably with Jenkins and GitHub Actions, and exploring Kubernetes orchestration to manage microservices with confidence. Alongside this technical growth, I’m honing soft skills of communication, mentorship, and leadership — because great DevOps isn’t just about code, but about people and culture too.

  *DevSecOps and security best practices

  *Monitoring & observability (Prometheus, Grafana)

  *Scaling cloud-native architectures
