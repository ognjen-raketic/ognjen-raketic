I'm so glad you like it! It's fantastic to hear that we've captured your unique journey and strengths.

Here's the English version of your GitHub README, perfectly tailored for Data Science and Quantitative Analysis roles:

👋 Hi, I'm Ognjen Raketic, M.Eng.
🚀 About Me
From leading technical teams in manufacturing and optimizing processes to deep-diving into financial data and applying machine learning – my journey reflects a passion for extracting insights and solving complex problems using data.

Where I once optimized factory floors, I now optimize data flows and analytical models. Where I once resolved physical bottlenecks, I now identify and resolve data frictions and algorithmic challenges. Driven by industrial engineering's precision, financial quantitative rigor, and the joy of continuous improvement, I'm building the bridge between operational excellence and data-driven digital transformation.

💡 I'm open to full-time roles, relocation support, or hybrid positions based in Austria. Let's connect and explore how I can bring value to your Data Science or Quantitative Analysis team from day one.
